🪵 Pelletsheim — Realm of Flame, Frost, and Legacy
A land where wood meets wire, where forge-ash settles on snowy pines like prayer-dust.
Sky-furnaces hover over glacial mills, while moss creeps into server cores and steel.
Here, legacy is burned into machines and whispered through the roots of Eldertrees.

🏗️ The Foundry
A city-factory of endless elevation, where molten light pours through spires of iron and glass.

### Prompt
📉 The Errors
Corrupted machines, misaligned protocols, and rust-spirits born from neglected maintenance.
Glitches manifest physically — flickering lights, looping echoes, even ghost-code in the air.
The Errors must be purified or patched, lest they spread like wildfire through spirit and system.

📜 The Prophecy of the Burning Moon
Carved on ancient bark with rune-code glyphs, the scroll radiates a faint, dry warmth.
It tells of five maker-blooded hands and one beast uniting beneath an ember-red moon.

🔥 The Embercore
A sacred, eternal fire hidden beneath the Foundry — roaring with voices of the forgotten.
It pulses like a living heart, bound in heatproof stone and whispering in smoky tongues.
Those who touch it risk being consumed or enlightened — the core chooses whom it reveals to.

A ghost-web of runes and code, threading through machines, walls, and even the trees.
