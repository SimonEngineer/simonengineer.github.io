🔥 Sissel, Keeper of Fire and Ledger
Title(s): Emberwarden, Flame-Tongue, Registrar of Sparks
Age: Ageless, though appears late 30s
Role: Supervisor of combustion, rituals, fire compliance, and internal energy flow of the Foundry
Affiliation: The Foundry Core Circle
Aspect: Flame ∙ Memory ∙ Precision ∙ Custodianship

📖 Origins and First Sightings
Sissel’s past is cloaked in speculation and soot. Some claim she arrived with the first flame that lit the Foundry in 1897, stepping out of the ignition spark itself. Others believe she was once human — a brilliant combustion engineer who became bound to the Embercore during a failed experiment involving the Forest Flame.

What’s certain is that no record exists of her ever being hired, yet she has been present in every known photo, fire log, and safety manual for over a century — unchanged. Her presence seems tolerated by the Foundry’s systems as though she is both employee and infrastructure. When asked about this, she typically replies with, "Fire remembers what people forget."

🪵 Duties and Sacred Responsibilities
Sissel’s role is not managerial — it is custodial, spiritual, and precise. She is in charge of the Combustion Alignment Charts, the Fuel Resonance Ledger, and the secretive Spice Protocol, which governs safe fire interactions during high-magic lunar events.

She ensures that every ignition is intentional and meaningful. Fire, in her belief system, is not a tool — it is a living spirit that must be treated with reverence. She speaks to the flame before lighting any kiln. Workers must log their intentions with her before fueling any burner.

Some examples of her known duties:

Ledger Rituals: Every Monday morning, Sissel transcribes fire event data from digital logs onto parchment scrolls with ember-ink. These scrolls are burned in the Chimney of Binding, ensuring “the flame never forgets.”

Saltfire Trials: When a burner fails to light properly, she performs a ritual using salt, pine sap, and forgotten names from the Foundry’s rollbook. This nearly always corrects the issue — but once, the floor caught fire and burned a perfect circle through the concrete. That circle is now a protected symbol on Foundry maps.

Compliance Check: Her "inspections" often involve strange incantations and the sniffing of sawdust to “read the fuel memory.” Though management laughs, they never overrule her.

🌕 The Spice Protocol
Sissel is sole guardian of the Spice Protocol, a mystical-ciphered manual disguised as a cookbook for elk stew and gløgg. It contains flame spells disguised as instructions for when to add cloves or bay leaves. It is used during events like:

Burning Moons (lunar eclipses, when fire flows too freely)

Salt Reversals (when pellet composition inverts heat draw)

The Ember-Still (a state where no flame can be kindled unless awakened ritually)

The Protocol’s last pages are written in a script only Sissel seems to understand. She has refused all requests to digitize it, stating that "digital flames are too easily corrupted."

🔥 Connection to the Embercore
Sissel refers to the Embercore as “our heart beneath the floor.” She speaks to it when alone, and during winter solstice, she can be seen whispering over its open vent, releasing a single pine needle into the flame.

She claims the Embercore has moods and that it's growing restless. Some believe she feeds it more than wood — secrets, names, and perhaps even memories. Several newcomers have reported forgetting why they entered certain rooms after passing too close to her.

The rumor that the Embercore speaks back to her has never been verified — but surveillance equipment fails when aimed at her rituals.

✨ Mannerisms, Dress, and Aura
Wears a soot-darkened leather apron embroidered with runes that glow faintly under heat.

Smells of resin, cedar, and ozone.

Keeps two ledgers: one made of paper, one carved into fire-hardened bark.

Her fingers are always warm to the touch — unnaturally so, even in winter.

Often stares too long into flames, then speaks as though answering unheard questions.

Her demeanor is composed and distant, except during fire-start rituals, where her voice becomes strong, incantatory, and rhythmic.

🌿 Relationship to the Forest
Despite her role in managing combustion, Sissel respects the Nordwood Pines deeply. She walks their edges each dawn, murmuring small offerings into the moss.

She’s one of the only Foundry members allowed inside The Bark Codex’s grove without the trees closing ranks. She is said to have once retrieved a burning rune from a tree’s heart without suffering a single burn. Since then, the pines tilt slightly toward her when she passes.

Some say she carries an ember of the Forest Flame itself in her chest — a gift or curse from the forest, binding her to the equilibrium between destruction and renewal.

🧱 Philosophy and Belief
Sissel believes that fire is memory — not metaphorically, but literally. That the flames remember every story burned into them, every spark a flicker of what once was. This belief shapes her entire worldview:

“Wood is the skeleton of the past. Fire is its breath. What we burn, we become.”

She warns the young workers not to burn recklessly, for “the flame keeps score.” She believes that every unrecorded fire breeds imbalance, and every misuse of flame must be atoned for in ash and silence.

⚠️ Warnings and Prophecy
Sissel has prophesied a coming reckoning — a time when the Embercore will flare beyond control, consuming both Foundry and forest unless five sparks are aligned, five truths spoken aloud by five voices the flame has marked.

She keeps a small, locked drawer labeled “FINAL IGNITION”. No one knows what’s inside. It’s been unopened for decades, but the lock glows faintly red when Sissel walks by.

🕯️ Closing Image
In the dark hours before dawn, long before the others arrive, Sissel walks the catwalks of the Foundry alone, lantern in hand, stopping briefly at each machine to murmur a blessing, a calibration, or a quiet plea.

She is the fire’s keeper, the silent heart of Pelletsheim. She watches. She remembers. And one day, she will decide what burns — and what endures.
