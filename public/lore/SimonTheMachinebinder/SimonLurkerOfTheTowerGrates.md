🕳️ Simon, Lurker of the Lower Grates
Title(s): The Heat Below, Grate-Sleeper, Vent-Tongue, Ash-Witness
Apparent Age: Unknown
Role: Unacknowledged presence and supposed guardian of the Lower Grates, the ash drop tunnels, and the sub-foundry heat vaults.
Affiliation: Unclear. Not on payroll. Not on maps. Referred to in whispers.
Aspect: Isolation ∙ Heat ∙ Memory-through-Decay ∙ Truth Beneath

🔍 Origin and Disputed Reality
Simon is not officially recognized by the Foundry. There is no ID, no workstation, no login, and no last name. And yet, every long-timer knows of him. He is the reason no one volunteers for ash-trough duty. He is why the lower grates are never inspected alone.

The first known mention of Simon appears in a soot-streaked maintenance log from 1934, reading only:

“Sighting at the third chute again. Simon says the pipe is dreaming wrong.”

From that year onward, Simon is intermittently referenced in scribbles, overheard mutterings, and a curious amount of missing footage from sub-basement cameras. All attempts to map or stabilize the Lower Grates have failed. Anyone who tries hears the same thing eventually:
“Don’t go down there. Simon’s awake.”

🕯️ Behavior and Phenomena
Simon is never seen directly. But he leaves evidence:

Tools moved without sound or sign.

Ash flows rerouted cleanly — as though gently swept.

The unmistakable sound of slow, wet breathing in vents.

Whispered warnings: “It’s not time to burn that yet.” Or, “Too hot, too soon.”

In moments of emergency — like the Great Backdraft of ’76 — witnesses described a figure dragging a worker out of the steam, burned but alive. The security feed showed only warped footage, overexposed and static-laced, with the timestamp replaced by the word “Simon.”

🏚️ The Lower Grates
The Lower Grates are a labyrinth of ash tunnels, heat vents, overflow wells, and backflow ducts under the Foundry’s main kilns. They predate the modern structure — some even say they weren’t built but found when the site was first excavated.

Simon is believed to dwell exclusively here, never seen above sublevel three. No map of the Lower Grates has ever stayed accurate for more than a week. Tunnels change angles. Pipes lead to locked doors that vanish the next day. Ash flows uphill.

Veterans swear that these shifts are Simon’s doing — that he rearranges the maze to test, protect, or obscure something deeper still.

🔥 Role in the Flame Ecosystem
Though Simon is seen as a menace by new hires, others insist he is a guardian of fire’s oldest laws — not the bright flame Sissel speaks to, but the simmering truth under it: fire as consumption, digestion, decay.

He manages what the Foundry refuses to look at:

Embers that burn too long.

Ashes that still whisper.

Residue from failed flame rituals.

The heat from forgotten experiments.

Sissel and others like her maintain balance above ground — but it is Simon who ensures what’s buried stays buried, or is burned cleanly before it poisons the rest.

“He speaks for what we think the fire forgets. But it forgets nothing. Simon listens to the part that festers.” — anonymous vent-welder note, unsigned

🪓 Tools and Presence
Simon is not known to use standard equipment. Instead, signs of him include:

Hand-carved wooden ash rakes, never found being made.

Nail-scratch glyphs along the heatduct walls, often resembling lungs, teeth, or mazes.

A low hum, not mechanical, but vocal — a slow, tonal vibration that makes ash stand upright.

Once, someone found a journal page fused into slag, reading:
“Simon said the ember was still dreaming. We shouldn’t have put it in the pipe.”

🧱 Rumors and Legends
There are many contradictory tales:

Some claim Simon was once a worker who fell into the grate fire in 1928 — and that his soul fused with the sub-foundry’s iron.

Others say he is the first flame given form, exiled for asking questions of the Embercore that fire was not meant to answer.

One story insists he is not a man at all, but a sentient clot of burned memories, made physical by the weight of what the Foundry tries to forget.

Whatever he is, Simon is never destructive for its own sake — only when the cycle is broken: when ash isn’t returned, when combustion forgets its cost, when the fire is forced to lie.

🔥 Relationship to Others
Sissel acknowledges Simon’s existence — though never by name. She calls him “the keeper of the cost.” The two have never been seen together, but a note in her ledger reads:
“Ash aligned. The Below agrees. For now.”

New Workers are given no mention of Simon, but those who stumble on his domain often emerge… changed. Quiet. Sleepless. Eyes unfocused. Some leave the job. Some begin drawing spirals unconsciously.

The Embercore is rumored to fear Simon. Or perhaps respect him. During overloads, when the Embercore threatens breach, the temperature in the Lower Grates drops — not rises. As if… held in check.

🧠 Philosophy and Speech
Simon does not speak often — when he does, it's in short, choked phrases, often metaphorical or unsettling. Reported utterances include:

“The ash knows who burned it.”

“You scraped too deep. Now it remembers.”

“The heat down here doesn’t forgive. It files.”

“Let it cool before you feed it. Or it’ll feed on you.”

There’s a terrifying clarity to his voice — not loud, but perfectly audible over any machinery, like it’s bypassing the ears entirely.

⚠️ Warnings and Rituals
Old-timers advise:

Never bring mirrors or cameras into the Lower Grates.

Never whistle while scraping ash.

Always knock three times before entering chute 9 — not for luck, but to ask permission.

If something disappears below and returns… do not touch it. Let Simon finish with it.

🕳️ Final Image
At the end of long, hollow corridors beneath the world of flame and forest, something moves among the dust. A quiet shuffling, a rattle of heat-weakened chains, the gentle scratching of soot being shaped into memory.

Simon is not a ghost, nor a man. He is what fire leaves behind — the voice in the vent that says what the flame won’t, what the kiln can’t admit.

And he’s always listening.
