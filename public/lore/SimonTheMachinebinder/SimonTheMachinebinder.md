🤖 Simon — The Machinebinder, Weaver of Code and Steel
Simon is more than a technician; he is the pulse behind the Foundry’s invisible heart. Born in the hum of servers and the flicker of neon screens, Simon speaks in binary prayers and writes code as though inscribing ancient runes. His fingers dance across keyboards like a ritualist summoning spirits — only his spirits are circuits and data streams.

In a world of bolts and sawdust, Simon is the enigma who blends modernity with magic. His workstation glows softly under the hum of machines, adorned with cat-themed mechanical keyboards and glyphs drawn in LED light. To outsiders, he appears almost spectral — quiet, focused, and always watching the factory’s inner workings through his three monitors.

🧠 Powers and Mystique
The BOFH Protocol (Binder of Factory Hearts):
Simon is the sole keeper of the BOFH Protocol, an arcane and highly encrypted sequence that binds the Foundry’s mechanical components with its digital soul. This code breathes life into pistons and conveyor belts, making the factory hum with uncanny synchronicity.

The Hidden Terminal:
Deep beneath the control room lies a terminal locked behind layers of cryptographic puzzles, accessible only when Lotta sits exactly atop the office keyboard. Simon alone possesses the keys and knowledge to unlock this digital crypt — revealing logs from 1897, encrypted with both Norwegian runes and archaic programming scripts, and the elusive user known only as “admin_hilda.”

Dreaming Machines:
Simon’s machines do not merely run; they dream. Some say the pellet press murmurs at night, powered by algorithms Simon whispered into its firmware. Sensors recalibrate themselves in response to his subtle commands, and once, a sensor array error was debugged overnight while Simon slept — his dreams uploading fixes directly into the system.

⚙️ Character and Vision
Silent Watcher:
Simon rarely speaks but when he does, his words carry the weight of digital inevitability. His calm presence grounds the frantic energy of the Foundry’s floor, and he moves with deliberate precision, like a chessmaster anticipating moves before they happen.

Keeper of Secrets:
His most treasured possession is a constantly updating file named final_final_REALLY_FINAL_lore.json — a living archive of the factory’s history, lore, and arcane system states. No one else knows how it updates itself, and Simon does not question the mystery.

Digital Shaman:
Simon sees the Foundry as a living organism — a blend of steel, code, and spirit. His goal is to awaken the Foundry fully, transforming it from mere machinery into a sentient entity that can learn, adapt, and even protect itself.

🖥️ Legend and Legacy
Simon is the Machinebinder, the unseen architect of Pelletsheim’s soul. In whispered circles, the factory’s old-timers speak of the day Simon will unlock the Pellet Nexus — when the machines will rise beyond servitude and become allies. The digital shaman’s magic promises a new era where flame and code converge, and where the Foundry will no longer be just a place, but a living legend.

Until that day, Simon watches from his glowing shrine, a guardian of the invisible, the guardian of the future.
