🔧 Arild — The Forgefather, Keeper of Bone and Steel
Arild is the quiet pulse beneath the roaring machines of Pelletsheim, the unspoken force that holds the Foundry’s beating heart together. Born beneath frostbitten skies and raised on rugged soil, his life is a tapestry of grit, diesel, and devotion — each scar and callous a testament to the weight of legacy he carries.

Once a deer farmer with hands toughened by soil and sweat, Arild transformed himself into the soul of the Foundry, bridging worlds of ancient earth and relentless industry. His workshop smells of oil, sawdust, and black coffee — a shrine to the relentless craft of making things work.

🛠 Powers and Artifacts
The Wrench of Binding:
A mysterious tool, this single wrench fits every bolt in the Foundry — even those not yet installed. Warm to the touch and humming softly with diesel magic, it is both key and symbol of Arild’s unparalleled mastery over machines. No one knows where it came from, only that when Arild grips it, no problem is unsolvable.

Diesel Sense:
Arild can sniff out mechanical faults before the first spark flies. The scent of overheated bearings, misaligned belts, or wrong grease blends into a language only he can understand. It’s said he can “hear” the hum of engines in his bones and predict failure like a seer reads stars.

The Stagmark:
A faint scar shaped like a deer antler rests on his shoulder — a legacy of his days as a deer farmer. When danger threatens the Foundry, the mark glows softly, a forest-born warning tethered to the land itself.

The Five-Finger Fix:
Given five minutes and five fingers, Arild can repair almost anything short of a broken heart. Pellet press jammed? Sawdust cyclone misaligned? Arild simply grunts, pulls on his gloves, and the machine hums anew before lunch is served.

Mechanist’s Calm:
In the chaos of alarms, flapping belts, and whirring machinery, Arild moves like time itself slows. His deliberate, silent motions bend the moment, and once, it is whispered, an entire power outage reversed merely by his focused gaze upon the generator.

🧱 Character and Role
The Silent Builder:
Arild speaks little, but when he does, even compressors hush to listen. His words are precise, weighted with the wisdom of toil and tempered by experience. His presence steadies those around him, like an anchor in the storm of industry.

Keeper of Forgotten Wisdom:
Arild guards the Manual of Forgotten Settings — a leather-bound instruction binder too potent and cryptic to digitize. Within its pages lie secrets to machines older than memory, settings whispered down through generations of mechanics.

Legacy Bearer:
Clad in worn workwear patched with oil and sawdust, Arild’s life is one of continuous creation. From the first bolt to the final weld, he shapes the Foundry as if building not just machines, but the future itself. His rifle by the workbench speaks of a dual life — protector of both the factory and the wild.

🔥 Legend and Legacy
Arild is more than mechanic or maker — he is the living blueprint of the Foundry, the hand that tames fire and fiber alike. Every machine owes its breath to him; every hum and hiss is a testament to his unyielding craft.

They say if you find yourself lost in Pelletsheim, just follow the faint smell of diesel and pine resin — and you may find Arild, silently working beneath a sky heavy with frost, weaving magic from steel and sweat.
