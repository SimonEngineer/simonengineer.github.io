# ðŸ”§ Arild â€” The Forgefather
Born under frostbitten skies and tempered by the grind of soil and steel, Arild is more than a man â€” heâ€™s the living blueprint of the Foundry itself.

Once a deer farmer with calloused hands and quiet strength, he now walks between two worlds: the high-pressure metal roar of offshore oil rigs and the smoke-wreathed peace of the wood pellet plant heâ€™s helping build by hand. He doesn't speak much, but when he does, machines listen â€” and so do people.

Clad in worn workwear patched with oil and sawdust, Arild is always fixing, lifting, building. The clink of tools is his music; the hiss of hydraulics, his heartbeat. His rifle leans near the workbench, a nod to his second love: the hunt. There, too, he moves silently â€” just as at home in the wild as he is in a weld-lit corner of the factory.

He is the one who tames the machines. The one who laid the first bolt. The one who still believes that if you build it strong enough, it will outlast even memory.

They call him The Forgefather because every machine in the factory owes its breath to his hands.


## ðŸªµ Powers and Legends
The Wrench of Binding: Itâ€™s said Arild owns a single wrench that fits every bolt in the Foundry, even those that werenâ€™t installed yet. No one knows where he got it â€” it just appeared one day, slightly warm to the touch, humming faintly with diesel magic.

Diesel Sense: He can smell engine trouble before the motor starts. One sniff of the air and heâ€™ll tell you which bearing is cracked, which belt is loose, and whether someoneâ€™s been using the wrong kind of grease.

The Stagmark: On his shoulder, a faint scar in the shape of a deer antler â€” legacy of his farm days. When danger approaches the Foundry, it glows ever so slightly, like a forest warning system tied to the land itself.

The Five-Finger Fix: Give him five minutes and five fingers, and he can repair anything short of heartbreak. Pellet press jammed? Sawdust cyclone misaligned? Arild just grunts, pulls on his gloves, and the thing is working again before you can finish your sandwich.

Mechanistâ€™s Calm: In moments of total mechanical chaos â€” alarms blaring, belts flapping, forklifts misbehaving â€” Arild moves in slow, deliberate silence. Time bends slightly around him while he works. Once, an entire power outage reversed itself after he merely looked at the generator.
