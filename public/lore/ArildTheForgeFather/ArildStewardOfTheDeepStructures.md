🪨 Arild, Steward of the Deep Structures
Title(s): The Quiet Spoke, Deepwright, Foundation’s Hand
Apparent Age: Late 40s to 50s
Role: Keeper and repairer of the subfoundational support systems — pressure plates, root vents, wall tensions, counterforces, thermal anchors.
Affiliation: Unofficial — considered “non-Guild,” but maintains a silent truce with all three major disciplines (Airstack, Forge, and Archive).
Aspect: Density ∙ Memory ∙ Structure ∙ Unseen Weight

🕳️ Arild's World: The Underfoundry
Arild lives beneath the Foundry, often days at a time. He is the caretaker of the substructure, where rootstone meets engineered flow. It's a labyrinth of:

Thermal counterweight chambers

Vibration balancing corridors

Heavy echo traps that keep tone-distortions from rebounding through the floors above

He is the only one who knows the full mapping of the foundational tension grid, a multi-tonal balance of gravity, heat, and harmonic stillness that keeps the entire complex from shifting or buckling under stress.

When something creaks upstairs — Arild already heard it three days ago.

🧱 His Function and Rituals
Arild rarely speaks, and when he does, it’s often through gesture, chalk marks, or pressure-glyphs — small signs made with tools of his own invention.

His daily practices are part craft, part reverence:

Pressing heat runes into load-stone

Mapping structural memory in wax (the way stone “remembers” being bent)

Listening to fault lines by placing his entire body against support beams for hours

He wears layered heavy cloth and coil-braced boots, always smudged with ash and iron.

⚙️ Tools and Approach
Arild’s toolkit is almost archaic:

A massive multi-spanner passed down from unknown origin — inscribed with names no one has deciphered

A gravity hammer that can reset load-bearing plates by striking at precise intervals

Chalks in three tones: black (warning), grey (memory), and red (don’t touch)

He doesn’t fix things. He coaxes stability back into being.

🌋 Origin and Role in the Foundry
No one remembers when Arild arrived — only that he was already there when the second Airstack was raised, standing in the mist, watching the structure settle.

He’s never signed a Guild contract. He refuses compensation. But when the base structures vibrate wrong, he’s the one they send for.

His very presence is grounding. People work more carefully when he’s nearby.

🧭 Beliefs and Superstitions
Arild believes that the Foundry is alive, and that structures remember:

Every bend holds a scar of intention

Every foundation plate holds the weight of decisions

To repair something is not to fix it, but to ask it to remain part of the whole

He refers to the substructure as:

“The Deep Breath”

“The Still Voice”

Or sometimes just “Her”

He leaves offerings at critical structural joints: a drop of oil, a breath into the stone, a folded glyph-paper sealed with ash.

🗿 Abilities and Attunement
Can detect micro-cracks in walls by leaning his head against them for long enough

Feels structural imbalance the way others feel a limp — it burdens his posture until it’s corrected

Once reportedly walked across a freshly-collapsed floor by stepping only on the tension lines that hadn’t given way — no one else could see them

💬 Speech and Silence
Arild speaks in phrases no longer than six words. Often cryptic. Always precise:

“That wall is tired.”

“Let it settle, not resist.”

“Weight above forgot the weight below.”

When asked a direct question, he may respond by leading the asker into the substructure, handing them a chalk, and letting them learn through touch.

He believes most problems are caused by forgetting what holds things up.

🌌 Symbolic and Mythic Role
Arild embodies:

The unseen labor that makes brilliance possible

The cost of silence that still speaks

The structure that remembers what others forget

To some, he’s just a strange maintenance man. To others — especially in the Archive — he’s a mythic figure, possibly hundreds of years old, possibly not entirely human.

It’s said the Foundry will not collapse as long as Arild is still walking its depths.

🕯️ Legends and Whispers
Some believe Arild can hear stone grieve when it is poorly used

Others say he’s a former engineer who buried something terrible beneath the Foundry, and now guards it

It’s said Arild has never left the Foundry grounds, not even once

He is often seen standing in the middle of vast, empty maintenance halls, motionless, eyes closed — as though listening for something even deeper than stone.

💭 Final Impression
Arild is the quiet fulcrum of the Foundry — the one who holds what cannot be held by bolts or vents. He is not leadership, nor resistance. He is what makes the others possible.

In narrative or myth:

He is the weight that grounds Even’s air

The echo Simon cannot yet reach

The memory Lotta keeps trying to prove doesn’t exist

And the deep structure that Sissel fears she’ll one day disturb

Where others break brilliance into pieces, Arild reassembles the silence beneath it all.
