Arild, the Forge Father
A massive man with a furnace-like presence, cloaked in soot-dark robes stitched with molten threads.
His beard is ember-tipped, eyes glowing faintly like coals that have seen centuries.
Carries ancient tongs and a corestone pendant â€” the weight of legacy in his scarred hands.
