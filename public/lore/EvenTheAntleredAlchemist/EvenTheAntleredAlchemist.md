🦌 Even-André — The Antlered Alchemist, Keeper of the Deep Herd
Even-André is a living bridge between the untamed wild and the meticulously engineered heart of Pelletsheim. His footsteps trace the boundary where salmon swim against the current and reindeer tread through frost-crusted moss. Once a lord of antlered herds roaming the northern mountains, he has since become the alchemist who blends forest, river, and smoke into a delicate equilibrium that sustains both life and industry.

Clad in weather-beaten waterproof boots and garments that smell of salt and cedar, Even-André commands respect from creatures and machines alike. His very presence carries the whispers of tides and trees, a hum of natural magic intertwined with crafted steel.

🌊 Powers and Legends
The Whispering Antlers:
Even-André’s antlers are said to resonate with primal energy. They glow faintly in moonlight and pulse with the rhythm of the earth’s veins. Legends say he can speak to both salmon and stags alike, commanding their movements with a mere nod or whispered word. Some claim his antlers are conduits to a secret underground network of heat tunnels beneath Pelletsheim — a living interface between fire and water.

The Sogne Scroll:
His most treasured possession is the Sogne Scroll, a weathered, water-stained manuscript bound in leather and algae. This ancient document holds maps of subterranean thermal currents and saltwater pathways that power the hydraulic systems beneath the Foundry. It is said that the scroll also contains rituals for summoning the “Deep Herd,” a phantom congregation of deer and fish that maintain balance between flame and frost.

Mediator of the Elemental Council:
When forest spirits quarrel with salt gods, or when the tides threaten the woodlands, Even-André steps in as an impartial arbiter. His voice is calm but firm, weaving old-world diplomacy with uncanny insight. Few understand his language of nods, whistles, and gestures, yet all recognize the peace he brings.

🧪 Secrets and Roles
The Deer-Salmon Hybrid Dream:
Even-André’s deepest ambition is whispered among the factory’s elders: to create a new lifeform, part deer and part salmon, capable of surviving on pellet dust and bridging land and water in harmony. Some say he’s already begun secret experiments in the smokehouses, feeding strange feed to salmon while watching the deer herds with knowing eyes.

Keeper of Smoke and Tide:
He oversees both the salmon tanks and the smokehouses, ensuring that the ancient techniques of preservation blend with modern methods. His smoke is infused with subtle herbal tinctures, harvested from the deepest groves, that are said to ward off mechanical corruption and preserve the soul of the wood.

Trainer of Unlikely Allies:
It’s rumored that Even-André once taught a trout to detect coolant leaks and a ptarmigan to sort screws by diameter. While this sounds absurd, his colleagues have occasionally found salmon scales next to the factory’s finest tools, and birds perched in unlikely places, silently watching.

🌲 Legend and Prophecy
In the whispered cycles of Pelletsheim, Even-André is known as “the one who feeds both land and water.” When the Pellet Nexus opens beneath the Burning Moon, it is said he will be the one to calm the first fires of the Embercore and guide the flow of salt currents that sustain the factory’s life-blood. Until that time, he walks the borderlands — an elemental alchemist, forever balancing flame and flood, forest and forge.
