🌬️ Even, Apprentice to the Stacks
Title(s): The Listening One, Foil-Keeper, Draftling
Apparent Age: Late teens or early twenties
Role: Apprentice to Hege; tasked with minor calibrations, listening runs, and reactive adjustments. Unusually sensitive to non-mechanical signals within the stacks.
Affiliation: Airstack Guild (provisional), under mentorship contract with Hege
Aspect: Sensation ∙ Intuition ∙ Listening ∙ Tension Before Movement

🌫️ Nature of the Apprenticeship
Hege rarely takes on apprentices — Even is only the second in fifteen years. Chosen not for technical excellence, but for a rare attunement to non-auditory signals within the airflows. He can “feel” misalignment before the baffles register it, like an ache in the teeth before a storm.

Even’s primary duties include:

Reading and mapping foil-crease sheets

Monitoring tone-shift from whisper flues

Calibrating minor stack harmonics

Accompanying Hege on vertical runs

He wears soft-cloth wraps and leather earpads, designed to muffle the louder tones of the stacks and let subtler ones through. His journal is thick with smudged graphite, wind-borne glyphs, and annotations made in scent, not ink (via ash-oil pens).

🌬️ Origin and Selection
Even came from the outer dormitory rings — a child of utility scrubbers, considered "airborn" from an early age because of his habit of sleeping in vents, climbing ductwork, and predicting minor quakes before sensors.

During an unseasonal ventstorm, Hege found him crouched in a pressure chamber, scribbling down the vibrations using a piece of foil and his breath. She read it, blinked once, and took him in on the spot.

No tests. No questions.

🔍 Abilities and Attunement
Even is hypersensitive to environmental subtlety. Where others rely on calibrated rods and complex machines, Even:

Measures shifts in how pressure touches skin

Senses “wrong air” — displaced or stale currents

Can determine direction by smell of hot metal in wind

This sensitivity makes him:

Prone to migraines during stack-lash events

Frequently overwhelmed in echo chambers

Exceptionally fast at vent-tuning via “listening stance” — a posture where he simply sits, breathes, and waits

Hege once said:

“Even doesn’t hear the stacks. He hears **what they regret not saying.”

🧪 Tools and Techniques
Even favors tools that extend his native intuition rather than override it. His kit includes:

Pressure-foil rolls, worn in a back sling

A handheld vibration lantern that glows differently in distorted air

A series of aura-seals: clay tabs that “close” bad flows by sticking to walls and redirecting motion

He is the only person in the Foundry who can install a seal blindfolded and hit perfect pressure balance.

🌀 Emotional and Mythic Role
In the larger lore of the Foundry, Even represents the premonition of collapse — the moment before failure or brilliance. The boundary where intuition may save or betray.

Some of the vent-priests claim Even is:

A wind-scourged reincarnate

“Stack-blooded” (born during a pressure inversion)

Or even a vessel for forgotten messages trapped in upward flow

Whatever the truth, Even dreams in airflow. He wakes with messages on his hands: spiral marks of soot or drafts of symbols that later match stack tones.

🕯️ Rituals and Beliefs
Even observes a few unique rituals of his own, believed to be inherited or made up:

“Breath-tracing”: walking blindfolded through a corridor with arms out to map draft speed by touch

“Foil-grieving”: pressing used calibration foil against the wall of a failed shaft to “listen” to its last breath

Never speaks inside the East Stack. Ever. “It listens back.”

He once left a perfect spiral of bone ash around a pressure leak — without ever being shown how the leak formed. Hege merely nodded.

🪁 Challenges and Tensions
Even is gifted, but not yet confident. He doubts his impressions, second-guesses his sensations, and tries to “learn like others” — even though his strength lies elsewhere.

This creates tension with:

Lotta, the other apprentice, who sees his methods as "lucky guesses"

Hege, who urges him to trust the stack, not the standard

The Airstack Guild, which sees him as untested and possibly unstable

There are days the wind “screams” at him — especially after misaligned ventings. He suffers from echo-dreams, where he hears calls for help that never happened — or haven’t yet.

💭 Quotes and Impressions
“It felt... sharp, but also like regret. Like something went out of tune two days ago and didn’t tell anyone.”

“I don’t need to fix it yet. I just need to hear why it’s wrong.”

“The foil sang in a spiral. That means loss, not failure.”

Even speaks rarely but precisely — often in synesthetic terms. (“That airflow tasted blue and wrong.”)

🏗️ Future Role and Symbolic Power
Even is likely to become either:

A new kind of Windwright, more empath than engineer

Or burned out by the pressure of translating what can’t be explained

Some say he’s meant to replace Hege. Others fear he’ll vanish into the stacks, leaving only a spiral of ash and a humming sound that never resolves.

Regardless, he is becoming a living threshold — a reminder that not all wisdom comes from mastery, but from listening where no one else dares.
