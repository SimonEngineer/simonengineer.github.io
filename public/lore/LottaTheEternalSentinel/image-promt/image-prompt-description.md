Lotta, the Eternal Sentinel (Finnish Lapdog)
A solemn, wool-thick Finnish Lapdog with eyes like obsidian orbs â€” impossibly ancient and aware.
Her fur is braided with tiny bone charms and rune-etched tags that glow faintly at night.
She watches in silence, standing sentinel beneath the Eldertrees or at the gate to flame.
