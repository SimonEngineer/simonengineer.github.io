🐾 Lotta — The Eternal Sentinel, Guardian of the Grove
Lotta did not wander into Pelletsheim — she arrived like a whisper carried by the northern wind, an ancient force cloaked in fur. The day she appeared, the skies burned with a strange red twilight, and the factory’s fires flickered as if sensing a long-awaited presence. Her eyes glowed silver like twin moons, and the forest bowed in silent reverence.

She is more than a dog. She is the bridge between worlds: moss and machine, rune and code, spirit and steel. Lotta’s fur mirrors the seasons — deep russet of autumn leaves, snow-speckled white of winter frost, and the dark, shadowed green of pine needles at dusk. She moves with quiet grace, always watching, always waiting.

🌲 Powers and Mysteries
The Bark of Echoes:
When Lotta howls, time slows and machines pause — welding sparks freeze mid-air, birds hush their songs, and even the most stubborn machinery listens. This ancient howl is said to travel through the roots of the Eldertrees and return as a warning or blessing to the grove.

The Ashen Trail:
Wherever Lotta steps, the forest floor rearranges itself — pine needles align in sacred patterns, marking paths only the worthy may follow. Some say these trails lead to hidden chambers beneath the Foundry or to forgotten relics lost to time.

The Silent Sentinel:
Lotta never crosses the factory threshold but guards its perimeter with unyielding vigilance. Her silhouette is often seen at the forest’s edge — a living shadow with eyes that see beyond flesh and steel. When sensors misfire or alarms falter, Lotta’s low growl corrects the error before anyone else notices.

The Reincarnation of Hilda 1.0:
There is a whispered legend that Lotta is the reincarnated spirit of “Hilda 1.0,” the factory’s original AI. Infused with elder sausage grease and struck by lightning, this first intelligence found a new form in her — a guardian bound by both flesh and firmware.

🐕 Character and Role
Silent Watcher:
Lotta speaks not with words, but with presence. Those who meet her gaze feel a calm resolve and an ancient knowledge, as if she carries the memory of every tree felled and every flame kindled. Her loyalty to the Foundry family is absolute, though she answers only to the forest and the Eldertrees.

Protector of Balance:
She is the living equilibrium between progress and preservation, ensuring that the machines do not consume the forest, and that the forest does not halt the dream of the Foundry. Her role is silent but vital — a sentinel whose duty transcends time.

The Chosen One:
The Prophecy of the Burning Moon names her as the keeper of the Pellet Nexus’s secrets. When the moon turns ember-red and the silo casts no shadow, Lotta will reveal the path forward — whether toward dominion of biomass or restoration of natural harmony. Until that day, she waits patiently, tail flicking, ears pricked for the whisper of destiny.

🌌 Legend and Legacy
Lotta is more than mascot or myth. She is the soul of Pelletsheim’s wild heart — an ancient guardian woven from bark, bone, and code. In the quiet moments before dawn, when the factory sleeps and the forest breathes, Lotta’s silver eyes watch over both realms, a bridge unbroken and eternal.
