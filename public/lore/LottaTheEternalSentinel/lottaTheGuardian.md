# **🐾 Lotta the Guardian of the Grove**
In the deep shadows of the Nordwood Pines, where fog lingers low and the trees seem to whisper in tongues older than time, walks a creature of legend — Lotta, the Guardian of the Grove.

Once thought to be an ordinary Finnish Lapphund, Lotta revealed her true nature the night the first pellet press was ignited. As the moonlight struck the sawdust-laced clearing, her eyes shimmered with a silver glow, and the winds fell silent — as if the forest itself paused in reverence.

Her fur, a regal blend of black, russet, and snow-dusted white, flows like a cloak woven by the seasons. Her stance is noble, her gaze piercing, with a subtle, knowing smile that suggests she has seen the rise and fall of more than one wood empire.

They say she was chosen by the Eldertrees, ancient sentient pines at the heart of the forest, to protect the balance between the natural world and the mechanized dream of the Pellet Foundry. She stands watch at the edge of the factory — never entering, but always present, her silhouette often seen just beyond the timber stacks.

### 🪵 Powers and Legends:
* **The Bark of Echoes**: When she howls, machinery pauses, birds fall silent, and even welding sparks seem to freeze. It’s said the sound travels to the roots of the trees and back — a forest-wide alarm system.
* **The Ashen Trail**: Wherever she steps, old pine needles shift into perfect order. No one knows how or why.
* **She Speaks to Deer**: Some say Even-André's old deer herd bowed to her. One reportedly wept.

Lotta is not just the mascot. She is the spiritual protector of the Sawmill Saga — a being that bridges worlds: machine and moss, code and claw.

It is whispered that when the final pellet is pressed and the moon aligns over the silo, Lotta will choose a successor. But until then, she remains ever-vigilant, a silent guardian watching from the forest’s edge — tail twitching, ears flicked forward, ready for whatever stirs in the shadows.
