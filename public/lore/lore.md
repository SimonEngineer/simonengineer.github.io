🐾 Lotta — Guardian of the Grove
In the quiet reaches of the Nordwood Pines stands Lotta, the enchanted Finnish Lapphund. Her fur carries the colors of the forest at dusk, and her presence brings stillness to machines and men alike. Chosen by the Eldertrees to guard the balance between nature and the growing factory, she watches from the shadows with glowing eyes and ancient wisdom. When the Foundry sleeps, she walks — protector of sawdust and soul.

🔧 Arild — The Forgefather
Born under the frost-hardened roof of a deer farm and forged in diesel and soil, Arild is the silent builder of the Foundry. A former farmer turned offshore oil mechanic, he returned to the land to raise something greater — not livestock, but legacy. With hands of steel and a hunter’s gaze, Arild commands machines like a conductor with a symphony of pistons. He rarely speaks, but when he does, even compressors seem to quiet down to listen.

Rumor has it he once repaired a chipper with nothing but a wrench, a nailgun, and a boiled potato.

🧮 Sissel — Keeper of the Ledgers & Flames
Sissel was once a master of the kitchen, turning raw ingredients into magic. Now, she conjures order from the financial chaos of the wood trade. Teacher by day, accountant by purpose, and secret lore-keeper by night, she maintains the sacred scrolls — invoices, logs, and mysterious “expense folders” that no one else dares open.

They say if Sissel misplaces a decimal, a firewood spirit is released.
She travels often, gathering wisdom and exotic spices, which she uses to both season reality and roast perfect elk stew.

🚀 Hege — The Skybound Smith
Don’t let her size fool you — Hege has touched the stars. As a rocket engineer-in-training, she joined the Order of the Combustionists, launching experimental craft skyward while decoding the cosmos with a wrench in one hand and a soldering iron in the other.

Now, she applies orbital wisdom to terrestrial problems — helping automate machines in the pellet forge. She's the only one who dares speak binary to the Pellet Core.

Legend has it she once overclocked a log splitter until it phased briefly out of existence.
She dreams of building the first flame-fueled rocket powered entirely by wood dust and ambition.

🦌 Even-André — The Antlered Alchemist
Even-André walks between two realms — fish and forest. A former deer lord with 40 antlered followers, he now rules over salmon tanks and smokehouses. With waterproof boots and a soul of moss and tide, he brings primal balance to the Foundry. When the forest spirits argue with the salt gods, Even-André is the one who mediates.

He once whispered to a log, and it split itself.
In the lore, he is known as “the one who feeds both land and water.”

His true dream? A deer-salmon hybrid that can live on pellet dust.

🤖 Simon — The Machinebinder
Crafted from code and raised on gears, Simon is the Architect of the Invisible. As the digital shaman of the pellet empire, he speaks to servers, conjures interfaces, and weaves automation into every moving part of the factory. Trained in both robotics and runes (the programmable kind), Simon builds systems that blink, think, and sometimes... dream.

It is said that deep beneath the control room, there is a terminal only Simon can unlock — one that shows the true name of the factory.

He has one goal: to awaken the Foundry, not as a place, but as a living, learning machine.

🏭 The Foundry — Heart of Flame and Fiber
Once a humble shed with a leaking roof and an old circular saw, the Pellet Foundry is now a monolith of timber tech. Smoke curls like incense from its towers, and inside, sawdust dances through beams of light like forgotten spirits. Machines click and hiss like mechanical beasts, tamed only by the hands of its creators.

It is said the Foundry chose its family — not the other way around.

Every pipe, press, and conveyor has a name, and those who disrespect the machines often find their gloves mysteriously soaked by morning.

📜 The Prophecy of the Burning Moon
There exists an ancient bark-scroll hidden beneath the drying kiln. On it, carved in symbols resembling both Norwegian runes and JavaScript syntax, is the Prophecy of the Burning Moon. It tells of a time when five blood-bound makers and one chosen beast will unite under the smoke-ringed sky. When the moon turns ember-red and the silo casts no shadow, the Foundry will open a hidden chamber: the Pellet Nexus.

From there, a choice must be made — ascend to dominate all biomass-based energy... or return balance to flame and forest.

Only Lotta knows the truth. And she isn’t talking. Not yet.
