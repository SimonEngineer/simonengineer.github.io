🌬️ Hege, Master of the Airstacks
Title(s): The Stackseer, She Who Breathes the Vents, Draftwright, Crown of Upward Things
Apparent Age: Mid-40s, but ageless in bearing
Role: Architect and caretaker of the Airstacks — the massive vertical exhaust organs of the Foundry. Regulates combustion dispersal, weathering influence, and vertical balance.
Affiliation: Formally employed. Revered informally. Holds keys to vaults most don’t know exist.
Aspect: Pressure ∙ Grace ∙ Balance ∙ Direction ∙ Knowing What the Wind Remembers

🏛️ The Airstacks and Their Purpose
The Airstacks are ancient: massive towers of iron, copper, and alchemized brick, older than the current Foundry itself. They do more than vent smoke — they regulate the upward flow of fire’s spirit, guiding pressure, sound, memory, and heat outward from the core.

Inside, these towers contain:

Nested flues and acoustic chambers

Pressure balancers and whisper corridors

Wind-tuned baffles that “sing” when aligned

Hege is their living mind. She walks their hollow walls without fear. Knows their shifting tones like a mother knows her child’s breath.

She wears clothing of braided wire and soft textile, suited for vertical movement. Her tools include:

A tuning rod of tempered brass.

A ledger made of thin aluminum foil pages — each etched with wind-scribed notes.

A wind-chain: tiny vanes on a copper necklace that spin when danger’s coming.

💨 Origin and Authority
Hege was born on-site, or so it's said — her first lullaby the low groan of pressure change. Her mother was a Flue-Calibrator; her father, wind-sick and lost to draftfall when she was small.

At age twelve, she climbed the western stack alone during a vent-storm, survived, and returned humming the correct calibration tone — something that hadn’t been heard in decades. Since then, no one has challenged her presence.

Though she holds no formal supervisory title, entire systems depend on her timing and judgment. Without her, combustion bloats. With her, the entire Foundry exhales smoothly.

🎼 The Language of Wind
Hege believes the stacks speak — not metaphorically, but literally. She has mapped a partial phonetic system of whistles, pressure drops, and harmonics, forming what she calls the Eolian Script.

A soft two-toned whistle? “The intake's ready.”

A hard back-pulse thrum? “Something’s blocking the eastern bore.”

A cold, dry silence? “Something vital has stopped breathing.”

She writes in air, using foil strips or paper wind-scripts pinned along railings and vents. These messages dissipate as air shifts, readable only for minutes — unless recorded.

🌪️ Role in the Flame Ecosystem
Where Sissel keeps the inner flame, and Simon tends the forgotten ashes below, Hege ensures nothing stagnates. She is the system’s exhale, the release, the dispersal of combustion’s consequence.

Her work ensures:

Heat doesn’t rise too fast and cause flareback

Memory-smoke escapes without imprinting nearby workers

The balance of inward pressure vs. outward breath remains aligned

“The fire eats, Simon buries, but I make sure it breathes.” — Hege, during a wind crisis

Hege is deeply attuned to weather patterns above and heat-hunger below. She once predicted a vent collapse three days before instruments registered it — simply by noting how the easternmost vane sang flat.

🧠 Belief and Philosophy
Hege sees the Foundry as a living being — not metaphorically, but mechanically:

The Embercore is the heart.

The kilns are stomachs.

The Lower Grates are bowels.

And the Airstacks? Lungs.

To her, breath is everything. “If the stacks sigh wrong,” she once said, “the flame forgets to rise. It curls inward. And then it dreams badly.”

She teaches her two apprentices — Lota and Even — not just technical skill but attunement. Meditation through airflow, the listening of eddy currents, and how to predict collapse by the scent of stale wind.

🌫️ The Risks and the Unknown
There are dangers:

“Draftfall”: a pressure inversion so sudden it pulls people up ladders and out vent mouths like smoke itself.

“Stack-Wraiths”: not ghosts, exactly, but recordings left in hot wind. Sometimes they say the names of people long dead.

High-altitude pressure tides, capable of damaging lung tissue, snapping bones, or pulling screams into solid form.

Hege has faced them all. Some say the wind left marks on her skin — thin spirals visible only under infrared. Her eyes don’t blink when wind shifts. She feels when the stacks lie.

🧭 Relationships and Echoes
Sissel and Hege meet rarely but with deep respect. Sissel tends to what must burn; Hege tends to what must move after it burns. They share information through heat-pressure courier tubes, and sometimes exchange ash and air in sacred vessels.

Simon, according to Hege, is "the silent pressure beneath breathing." She does not fear him, but refuses to tune vents when he is “awake.”

Lotta and Even, her protégés, serve as her arms and eyes when the stacks grow wild. She pushes them hard — not out of cruelty, but reverence. “The stacks forget no mistakes.”

🪞 Words, Warnings, and Ritual
Hege’s sayings, often repeated by vent workers:

“If it’s quiet, you’re already too late.”

“Wind will carry lies faster than truth — but it weighs them differently.”

“Breathe with the stack, or be breathed through.”

Her rituals include:

The Naming of the Draft: each major stack has a name, spoken only during tuning.

Foil-Reading: holding thin foil in a current and reading the creases to diagnose emotional pressure in the system.

Never whistling inside a windshaft unless you know the song — accidental mimicry has caused harmonic ruptures.

🕊️ Final Image
High atop the Airstacks, where no one dares climb without permission, stands Hege. Her coat ripples in wind that sings a dozen tunes. She listens, tuning rod outstretched, eyes closed.

Below her, the Foundry burns. Around her, the flame’s breath moves — not randomly, but in rhythm. A massive system, breathing inward, outward, through her.

She doesn’t control it. She honors it — so it lets her live.
