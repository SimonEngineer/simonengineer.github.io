🚀 Hege — The Skybound Smith, Dreamer of Flames and Stars
Hege is a paradox in motion — small in stature but boundless in vision, she carries the cosmos in her heart and a soldering iron in her hands. Born beneath flickering auroras and raised on stories of distant orbits, she turned the smoke and wood of Pelletsheim into fuel for her rocket dreams. Where others see logs and flames, she sees ignition and ascent.

Once a rocket engineer-in-training at the Northern Aerospace Guild, Hege left the sterile labs for the smoky chaos of the Foundry. Here, she blends rocket science with rustic mechanics, turning wood pellets into potential energy capable of launching dreams skyward. Her workbench is cluttered with tools, star charts, and schematics scribbled in binary and constellations.

🔧 Powers and Innovations
Orbital Pellet Array:
Hege’s magnum opus is the Orbital Pellet Array, a constellation of mini-satellites designed to redistribute warmth across the frozen reaches of Pelletsheim. Each node burns a carefully calibrated dose of pellet dust, creating a soft, sustainable heat rain upon the tundra below. Though still in prototype, it promises to reshape the way fire travels across land and sky.

PROJECT EMBERSTATION:
Within her satchel rests a USB drive labeled “PROJECT EMBERSTATION”, containing blueprints for a flame-fueled rocket — the first ever powered entirely by wood dust and ambition. The project is to be unveiled only during a lunar eclipse, when shadows dance long and secrets ignite.

Binary Tongue:
Hege speaks fluent machine code and star-lore, able to coax the Pellet Core into new states of efficiency simply by whispering firmware updates in binary. She once overclocked a log splitter until it briefly phased out of existence, earning her a mischievous reputation among factory hands.

🌠 Dreams and Character
Skybound Vision:
Hege’s eyes are always on the horizon — or beyond it. She dreams of building rockets that soar beyond the smoky clouds, carrying the essence of Pelletsheim into orbit and beyond. For her, wood pellets aren’t just fuel; they’re the spark of infinite possibility.

Quiet Maverick:
Despite her grand visions, Hege is modest and approachable. She often works late into the night, soldering circuits by the light of embers and stars. Her laughter is rare but contagious, and her presence a spark of hope in the Foundry’s dimmest hours.

Teacher of the New Flame:
Hege shares her knowledge with eager apprentices, teaching them to blend old-world craftsmanship with new-world technology. Under her guidance, the Foundry has begun to see fire not just as destruction, but as transformation.

✨ Legend and Legacy
Hege is known as the Skybound Smith, the one who forges dreams out of flame and dust. When the Prophecy of the Burning Moon unfolds, it is she who will unlock the skies — turning smoke and sparks into wings. Her flame-fueled rocket will not only carry fire into space but also the legacy of Pelletsheim’s union of nature and machine.

Until then, she toils beneath the stars, a celestial smith shaping the future from ember and ambition.
